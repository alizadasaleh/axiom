"""Grounded hypothesis pitch generation (PBI 5, scoped per OD16).

The original plan's Step 3 assumed a per-hypothesis pipeline: a user types a
free-text thesis idea (h_syn), the system scores its geometric novelty
(s_max) and citation-scenario verdict (Dead End / Fertile Frontier), then --
only for Fertile Frontier -- a 5-node LangGraph generates a hypothesis pitch.
OD9 replaced Steps 1-2 with a corpus-level community-pair detector that has no
per-hypothesis input, so that pipeline has nothing to plug into.

OD16 scopes Step 3 down to what's real: given one of OD9's already-ranked gap
candidates, generate a grounded pitch (title, claim, method_sketch, datasets,
supporting_paper_ids) citing real papers from BOTH sides of the gap. No
LangGraph dependency -- a single LLM call (axiom/llm.py, OD14) plus a
rule-based (not LLM self-report) Verifier that checks `supporting_paper_ids`
actually belong to the two communities and there are >=2 of them, retrying on
failure. Trend context (OD10 velocity) is folded into the prompt directly
rather than as a separate agent node.
