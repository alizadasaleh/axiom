"""SPECTER2 abstract encoder.

Committed team decision: allenai/specter2_base, 768-dim. If no GPU is available
we fall back to CPU and emit a clear warning — we never silently switch models.

Encoding recipe is the canonical SPECTER one: concatenate title and abstract
with the tokenizer's [SEP] token and take the [CLS] token of the last hidden
state as the document embedding.
