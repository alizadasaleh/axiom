#
# Corpus is built by SNOWBALL / 2-hop expansion (decision OD7): seed on a topic,

# --- Query-side embedding ----------------------------------------------------
# Terse queries ("LoRA", "TOOLS for AI") embed poorly when treated as documents
# and land in a mushy region of the space (flat ~0.82-0.88 scores). Two paths
# nudge the query vector toward the document region:
#   - "adapter":   SPECTER2 ad-hoc query adapter. Best, BUT the `adapters` lib
#                  pins transformers~=4.57, conflicting with our pinned 4.40.2,
#                  so it is unavailable without a committed-decision pin bump.
#   - "expansion": wrap the terse query in an abstract-shaped sentence. No new
#                  deps; works under the current pins. This is the active path.
QUERY_EXPANSION_TEMPLATE = "This paper presents {query} for natural language processing."

# --- Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) ---------------------------------------
# Dense SPECTER2 captures meaning; a sparse BM25-style vector captures exact
# terms/acronyms (LoRA, RAG, dataset names) that dense misses. Each point stores
# two named vectors; results are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
#
# NOTE: qdrant-client==1.9.0 has sparse vectors but NOT the Query-API fusion
# primitives (Prefetch/FusionQuery, client >= 1.10). We therefore run two native
# searches and fuse with RRF in Python — no pin bump required.

# --- Trends / velocity --------------------------------------------------------
# No PROJECT_PLAN.md exists in this repo (decision OD10) so there is no formula

VELOCITY_EPSILON = 1e-4          # smoothing so the log2 ratio never blows up on a 0 count
# A concept seen in only ONE paper in a window isn't a trend — its velocity pins
# to the epsilon ceiling (every 0->1 concept ties at the same value), so the
# Trending charts would show a flat wall of identical bars. Require at least this
# many papers in the window a concept is moving from/to before charting it; the
# full ranked list below the charts still shows everything, low-volume flagged.
VELOCITY_MIN_CHART_COUNT = 2

# Floor for the Trending tab's year filter. Snowball ingestion drags in cited
# references back decades, so the full span (e.g. 1975-2026) splits into a
# near-empty pre-2000 "prior" window and a huge "recent" one, making almost every
# concept a fake 0->N riser. We clamp the selectable "From year" to this floor so
# velocity is only ever computed over the modern, densely-populated years.

# + scripts/calibrate_gap_thresholds): G blends four normalized signals already
